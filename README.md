# Project: Salary Analysis
Analysis: Salary is hypothesized to depend on educational qualification and occupation. ANOVA is used to study the relationship between salary earned and the educational qualification and occupation.

Outcome: People with Doctorate education earn the maximum salaries and people with High school education earn the least. Thus, we can conclude that Salary is dependent on educational qualifications and occupation.

Business decision: Encourage more people to study so that they get better jobs and higher salaries. Better salaries mean they are able to pay taxes which indirectly improves the standard of city infrastructure.
